Research shows employee engagement can be inferred by analyzing digital work-related activities and relationships.

  - **Engagement**-  The degree of employee commitment and connection to their role and workplace (see engagement).
  - **Career Development**- The opportunity to learn, develop skills, and progress within the organization. A lack of career development is associated with increased employee turnover. Factors include promotion, recognition, and compensation cadence.

  - **Work load**- The amount of time invested daily in work-related activities. This driver focuses on working hours, after-hours work, and the ratio between working hours and breaks taken. 
  - **Cognitive load**- The level of mental resources required  to perform specific work-related tasks. This driver focuses on work patterns and their intensity.

  - **Equity**- An organizationâ€™s ability to ensure equal opportunities while acting with fairness and impartiality based on each individualsâ€™ needs.  
  - **Inclusion**- An organizationâ€™s ability to ensure that employees feel a sense of belonging and are comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work.

Research shows that diversity can be inferred by analyzing the representation of underrepresented groups (e.g. minorities, females, etc.) in key managerial positions, teams, informal communities, and in the organization as a whole.

  Equity can be calculated based on two main aspects - equity in HR processes such as compensation and promotions. Along with equity in relationships, specifically the fairness in attention and responsiveness when it comes to manager-employee relationships.
  
  Diversity and equity are metrics that the organization can act upon, whereas inclusion is intrinsic and varies from employee to employee. Thus, inclusion is determined by taking into consideration diversity and equity.`,
